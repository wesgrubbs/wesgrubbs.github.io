      "Geometric Playground is an open-source iOS application that brings the spirit of creative coding to mobile devices, reimagining generative art through SwiftUI's powerful animation capabilities. Drawing from years of experience with Processing and P5.js, the app features dynamic compositions of circles, squares, and gradients that respond to user interaction, while its open-source nature serves both as a learning tool for developers exploring SwiftUI's animation framework and as a foundation for future explorations in mobile generative art",

      "Since 2023, I've maintained a creative ritual that transforms design exploration into visual meditation. Through Figma, I craft abstract compositions that push the boundaries of shape and color, each piece serving as a distinct capsule of experimentation and artistic intuition. This growing collection of hundreds of designs, shared on Instagram, represents more than just a portfolioâ€”it's a living document of creative evolution, where each composition emerges from moments of inspiration and the pure joy of unrestricted play. The practice has become both a creative outlet and a technical exercise, allowing me to continually refine my design sensibilities while maintaining a space for spontaneous artistic expression.",
