    blurb:
      "Real-time 3D visualizations that transform music into flowing digital sculptures using WebGL and audio analysis.",
    year: "2024",
    description:
      "An experimental project exploring the visualization of sound waves through generative art. Using Web Audio API and WebGL, this project transforms music and ambient sounds into flowing, three-dimensional sculptures that react in real-time to audio input.",
    challenge:
      "Create an intuitive visual representation of sound that captures both the technical aspects of audio waveforms and the emotional qualities of music.",
    solution:
      "Developed a custom WebGL shader system that interprets audio frequencies and amplitudes, transforming them into organic, flowing forms that respond to the music's characteristics while maintaining visual coherence and aesthetic appeal.",

    year: "2023",
    description:
      "A creative experiment that transforms dry statistical data into generated poetry. Using natural language processing and custom algorithms, the project creates meaningful verses that reflect patterns and insights found in datasets.",
    challenge:
      "Find a way to make statistical data more emotionally resonant and memorable through creative interpretation.",
    solution:
      "Built a system that analyzes statistical patterns and maps them to poetic structures, creating verses that maintain mathematical accuracy while adding literary beauty.",
